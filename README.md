# Hello, I'm [Kifanga Mukundi](https://github.com/kifangamukundi)

### Full-Stack Software Engineer based in Nairobi, Kenya 🌍 | Available for Remote Work 💻

I’m a **full-stack software engineer** with a deep love for clean design, efficient systems, and elegant code.  

I started my frontend journey with **React**, leveled up with **Next.js**, and finally found my favorite framework — **Svelte** ❤️.  
On the backend, I began with **Node.js** and **Express**, but these days I’m fully in love with **Go (Golang)** for its simplicity, speed, and power.  

Also, I’m a proud **Vim user** — I like keeping my hands on the keyboard and my mind in the code.  

## What I Do

- **Frontend Development** → Crafting fast, reactive, and maintainable UIs with **Svelte**, **SvelteKit**, and **Tailwind CSS**.  
- **Backend Engineering** → Building robust, performant services in **Go** with clean architecture principles.  
- **System Design** → Architecting scalable systems with a focus on clarity, performance, and maintainability.  
- **DevOps** → Using **Docker**, **CI/CD**, and cloud platforms (especially **GCP**) to deploy with confidence.  
- **Databases** → Working comfortably with **PostgreSQL**, **MongoDB**, and designing efficient data models.  
- **Tooling** → Automating and scripting workflows with **Vim**, **Git**, and a Linux-first setup.  

## Currently Exploring

- Writing more **idiomatic Go** — clean concurrency, context handling, and modular services.  
- Building advanced **SvelteKit** applications with reactive data layers.  
- Experimenting with **microservices**, **message queues**, and **distributed systems** in Go.  
- Optimizing my **Vim workflow** (it’s a lifelong craft).  

## Technologies & Tools

Category | Tools & Frameworks |
**Frontend** | Svelte, SvelteKit, Tailwind CSS, Next.js, React |
**Backend** | Go (Golang), Node.js, Express |
**Databases** | PostgreSQL, MongoDB |
**DevOps** | Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines |
**Cloud** | Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Firebase |
**Languages** | Go, JavaScript, TypeScript, C++ |
**Editor & Tools** | Vim, Git, GitHub, Postman, tmux |

## Recent Work Highlights

- **Survey Builder** – A modular survey system built with **SvelteKit** and **Go**, supporting dynamic data units, condition logic, and JSON exports.  
- **Real-Time Chat App** – Built using **Go**, **WebSockets**, and **Svelte**, designed for low-latency communication.  
- **E-commerce Platform** – Scalable, cloud-deployed app combining **SvelteKit**, **Go**, and **PostgreSQL**.

## Let's Collaborate

I’m open to remote opportunities and collaborations involving:

- Svelte / SvelteKit frontends  
- Go backend systems  
- Scalable full-stack web architectures  
- Developer tooling and performance optimization  

If you love building things that **feel good, run fast, and scale well**, we’ll get along great.

### Philosophy

> _“Simple is better than complex — and fast is better than fancy.”_  
> Whether in Go, Svelte, or Vim, I believe in building software that’s clear, reliable, and a joy to maintain.
